## CS50 Blackjack Project
## Asher Vogel, Rory Doyle, Eli Rosenberg, Nate Roe

## Design Specification 
The design for this project was broken into four modules to make it easier to complete as a group. These modules were:
- Network - server code
- Dealer - driver for playing the game
- Player - algorithm to play and train
- Cards - data structures used in game

The overall design for the game is to store cards as an array of pointers. The decisions and training data will be stored in a modified hashtable. The cards data will include a struct for cards, for a deck, and for a hand. 

For more information concerning detailed design, please read the design specifications for each module.
