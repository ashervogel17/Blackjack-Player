## Implementation Specification 
The implementation for this project involved four different modules. These modules each have detailed implementation specifications. Please read those for more. 

The cards module implements three structs. These structs store cards as an array of pointers to card structs. The deck is shuffled using an adaptation of the Fisher-Yates algorithm for random generation of a permutation in linear time. All data generated by cards is indeed on the heap--consequently, the implementation includes delete methods to manage memory. 

The server module implements a server. Notable features include the inclusion of *time.h* and the use of its built in delay features. 

The dealer module drives the server module. 

The player module trains the algorithm using a modified hashtable.
